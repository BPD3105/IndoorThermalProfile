**Title of the Article:** Identification of Biomarkers for Arsenicosis Employing Multiple Kernel Learning Embedded Multi-Objective Swarm Intelligence
- **Authors:** Anirban Dey<sup>1</sup> , Student Member, IEEE, Kaushik Das Sharma<sup>1</sup>  , Senior Member, IEEE, Tamalika Sanyal<sup>2</sup>  , Pritha Bhattacharjee<sup>2</sup>  , Pritha Bhattacharjee (Sr.)<sup>2</sup> 
- **Affiliations:**  <sup>1</sup> Department of Applied Physics, University of Calcutta; <sup>2</sup> Department of Environmental Science, University of Calcutta 
- **Published in:** [IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7728)
- **About the Article:** There are around 30,000 genes in the human body out of which only a few gets deferentially expressed when exposed to any substance causing the development of certain disease. Therefore, finding those deferentially expressed genes is very important as well as it is a computationally complex task. In this article, the authors proposed a computationally efficient technique to deal with such problems specifically for arsenicosis. For a more detailed study of the proposed method, please find the paper in this [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35895661/)

## Dataset: Microarray data 


## About the Code

The proposed schema as discussed in the paper is implemented in Python. This repository contains `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebok) and `.py` (Python) files which contains modules which are further used to develop the entire schema.   

The details instruction for executing the entire package will be published post acceptence of this article or individuals' may send a request mail to the corresponding author at his official [e-mail](mailto:kdsaphy@caluniv.ac.in);
