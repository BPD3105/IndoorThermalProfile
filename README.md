## About the Code

The proposed schema as discussed in the paper is implemented in Python. This repository contains  `.py` (Python) files which contains modules that are further used to develop the entire schema.   

The details instruction for executing the entire package will be published post acceptence of this article or individuals' may send a request mail to the corresponding author at his official [e-mail](mailto:bpdaphy_rs@caluniv.ac.in);
